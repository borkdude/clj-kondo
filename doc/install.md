## Installation script (MacOS and Linux)

Ths installation script works for linux and MacOS and can be used for quickly
installing or upgrading to the newest clj-kondo without a package manager,
e.g. in CI. It will install to `/usr/local/bin` by default, but you can override
this location with the `--dir` option.

To download and execute the script:

    curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/master/script/install-clj-kondo
    chmod +x install-clj-kondo
    ./install-clj-kondo

or

    ./install-clj-kondo --dir /tmp

To upgrade, just run the script again.
