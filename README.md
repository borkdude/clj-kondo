A minimal and opinionated linter for Clojure code that sparks joy.

<img src="screenshots/demo.png" width="50%" align="right">

## Rationale

You don't mind the occasional [inline
def](https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2017/05/25/inline-def-debugging/) for
debugging, but you would like to get rid of them before making your code
public. Also, unnecessary `do` and `let` nestings don't really add any value to
your life. Let clj-kondo help you tidy your code.

## Features

* inline def warnings
* redundant do and let warnings
* arity errors across namespaces
* private function call errors

This linter is:

* compatible with .clj, .cljs and .cljc files
* build tool and editor agnostic

## Status

Under active development, but already useful. None of the code is meant to be exposed as a
public API, except the command line interface.

For new features I'd like to focus on things that
[joker](https://github.com/candid82/joker) doesn't support yet, so I recommend
enabling that one as well.

## Installation

### MacOS:

    brew install borkdude/brew/clj-kondo

### Linux

Install [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/). Then run:

    brew install borkdude/brew/clj-kondo

### Manual install

Pre-built binaries are available for linux and MacOS on the
[releases](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/releases) page.

### [Running on the JVM](doc/jvm.md)

## Usage

### Command line

Lint from stdin:

``` shellsession
$ echo '(def x (def x 1))' | clj-kondo --lint -
<stdin>:1:8: warning: inline def
```

Lint a file:

``` shellsession
$ echo '(def x (def x 1))' > /tmp/foo.clj
$ clj-kondo --lint /tmp/foo.clj
/tmp/foo.clj:1:8: warning: inline def
```

Lint a directory:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint src
src/clj_kondo/test.cljs:7:1: warning: redundant do
src/clj_kondo/vars.clj:291:3: error: Wrong number of args (1) passed to clj-kondo.vars/analyze-arities
```

Lint a project classpath:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint $(lein classpath)
```

## Project setup

To detect lint errors across namespaces in your project, a cache is needed. To
create one, make a `.clj-kondo` directory in the root of your project. A cache
will be created inside of it when you run `clj-kondo` with the `--cache` option.
Before linting inside your editor, it is recommended to lint the entire
classpath to teach `clj-kondo` about all the libraries you are using, including
Clojure and/or ClojureScript itself:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint <classpath> --cache
```

Build tool specific ways to get a classpath:
- `lein classpath`
- `boot with-cp -w -f`
- `clj -Spath`

So for `lein` the entire command would be:

    $ clj-kondo --lint $(lein classpath) --cache

Now you are ready to lint single files using [editor
integration](doc/editor-integration.md). A simulation of what happens when you edit a
file in your editor:

``` shellsession
$ echo '(select-keys)' | clj-kondo --lang cljs --cache --lint -
<stdin>:1:1: error: Wrong number of args (0) passed to cljs.core/select-keys
```

Since clj-kondo now knows about your version of ClojureScript via the cache,
it detects that the number of arguments you passed to `select-keys` is
invalid. Each time you edit a file, the cache is incrementally updated, so
clj-kondo is informed about new functions you just wrote.

## [Editor integration](doc/editor-integration.md)

## Exit codes

- `0`: no errors or warnings were found
- `2`: more than one warning was found
- `3`: more than one error was found

All other error codes indicate an unexpected error.

## Limitations

This tool uses static analysis on your source code. Therefore it cannot detect
all of the issues that a runtime linter can. This tool is written in Clojure and
compiles to native code using GraalVM. Any library that is problematic with
GraalVM can therefore not be used in this project.

## Tests

    script/test

## [Building from source](doc/build.md)

## Credits

This project is inspired by [joker](https://github.com/candid82/joker). It uses
[clj.native-image](https://github.com/taylorwood/clj.native-image) for compiling
the project. The parsing of Clojure code relies on
[rewrite-clj](https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj).
